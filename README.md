## Fruit detection
The purpose of this project is to find the amount of fruit in an image.  
Fruit that are going to be detected by the program are:  
* bananas,
* apples,
* oranges.
### Images used for detection
All images are located in [data](https://github.com/jakgrab/detect-fruit/tree/master/data) folder. These pictures are all taken from above and consist of different amounts of fruit.  
Furthermore, images differ in illumination.

An example of an input image can be seen below.
